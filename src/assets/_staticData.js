export const aboutMe = [
  "I used to work as network engineer for more than 10 years. Then, I had an opportunity to help with a problem with data inconsistencies between ISP (Internet service provider) network and internal systems/databases. So ~3 years ago, I started a project to develop network automation and discovery tool using Python, Flask, multiprocessing, PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I found I do like programming, data manipulation and solving problems (a little bit more, than networks). I am learning ever since.",

  "It was my first project. Its job was to find and collect information from network devices (scan ~800k host IP addresses), identify them, compare those data with company’s internal systems, create reports of inconsistencies and as a result, maintain “self” updated database. As it grown, it was connected to more internal systems, for example, we could enhance customer delivery process (automate device deployment, setup monitoring tool and so on).",

  "Next steps were to fully automate service delivery, configuration, develop auto-troubleshooting module and many other, however I have recently moved to San Diego to support my wife’s work here as a scientist at UCSD. Unfortunately, working remotely was not an option, so I had to quit.",

  "Currently, I am looking for a job here as a junior programmer. Meanwhile, I’ve started to learn MERN stack and I am working (for free) for another company in Czech republic trying to develop front-end (React) and back-end (Node) application to process, validate and upload monthly reports (required by law) to State institute for Drug Control. It’s my learning project for now with just a little chance it may grow from “data parsing” to “drug inventory” system for pharmaceutical companies.",

  "I should also mention that I'm eligible to work in the US and I don’t need any health insurance.",
